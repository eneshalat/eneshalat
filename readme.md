### Enes Halat
Currently computer engineering student, interested in programming and open source, tinkering with Linux around 5 years, ∞ code love!
## Welcome aboard!
Hi! I am Enes Halat and I'm here to learn coding better and also share my software ideas. I've been into programming for 8 years, and I love tinkering around with them since I was born. :D

### What will you find here?
You will find my latest repositories and ideas. They will be shared here as soon as I start to create them.
You will find many mistakes and many attempts to create a working program, most developers don't like to share them, but I do! That's the 'open source' spirit! :) I will share them here because they will be a great memory when I want to go on some nostalgia tour, and also I will be learning to use Git better in the process.

Most of my personal projects (like some projects those do not have any purpose and are just created for fun or experimenting) are on GitLab.com. If you want to take a look at them, you can reach them [here.](https://gitlab.com/eneshalat)

### Which programming areas are in your radar right now?
I am currently tinkering with:

 - C++
 - Embedded systems
 - System programming
 - Back-end programming
 - IoT and Local (LAN or LoRaWAN) Networking

### How can I contact you? 
You can contact me on matrix.org and LinkedIn! I am pretty active in these platforms. If you want to reach to me for business purposes, you can message me on LinkedIn! I will see your message if I am available.


### That's the end!
Thank you for looking to my profile page! If any of my software ideas inspire you or you think you can make that idea stronger, always feel free to contribute!
